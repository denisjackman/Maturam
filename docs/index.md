## Maturam Roguelike Game
### Introduction
Welcome to the home of Maturam a [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. This is an exercise in building a rogue like game. We will be using the tutorial hosted [here](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) as the basis for our work. There may be some changes as we go. These will be based on logic and neccessity.

## Changes
* Colours have been moved into their own file (colours.py) with entries being added as and when we come across them. I do have a list of all the regular colours (in RGB and Hex code) and will add them at some stage.
* The code is PYLINT compliant
* I added a CHEAT key (SPACE) which replenished HP as needed
